<h2>Roast Beef Step-By-Step</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li><br>
    <li>Make sure roast is at room temperature. Tie roast at 3-inch intervals with cotton twine; this helps it from drying out and allows it to cook more evenly. Place roast on a rack in a baking pan.</li><br>
    <li>Mix together salt, garlic powder, and pepper in a small bowl. Rub seasoning mixture into the meat.</li><br>
    <li>Place in the preheated oven and roast for 60 minutes, or 20 minutes per pound if your roast is larger or smaller. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 120 to 125 degrees F (49 to 52 degrees C).</li><br>
    <li>Remove from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Cover loosely with foil, and let rest so juices can redistribute, 15 to 20 minutes.</li><br>
    <li>Slice and serve.</li>
</ol>
